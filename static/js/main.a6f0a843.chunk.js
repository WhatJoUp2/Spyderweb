Usually wearing dark clothes and sporting a medium sized beard.","personality":"Cold and cruel, Marcus comes off as a sociopath to some. Extremely selfish and egotistical, his motivations tend to resolve around making money and taking revenge on those who wronged him.","powers":"Despite a lack of actual powers, Marcus is one of the few Mundanes to be able to handle his own against supers one or two classes above him. Making up for his lack of superpowers with martial arts training, cleverness and ingenuity. He wields a powerful handgun, Black Bolt, and a healthy supply of thermal grenades, using them to their fullest extent when dealing with police or heroes alike. While one of the lowest rated villains in this database, he is not to be underestimated, especially working with the Black Syndicate, providing him with plenty of goons to aid him.","achievements":"Over the course of his career, Marcus has been responsible for the robberies of 15 different banks, 3 of which remarked for incredible security. He\'s also been told be behind two prison breaks, 4 terrorist attacks, and 17 counts of murder and manslaughter, including the killing of Booster Flash, a young superhero. His position at the head of the Black Syndicate has remained for over 10 years now after he usurped his own father, Oliver Black, for supposedly getting too soft."},{"alias":"Mammoth","allegiance":"Villain","threatClass":"A","organization":"Independent","appearance":"An extremely tall, muscular man with long red/ginger hair, in his late 20s. When under his supervillain guise, he tends to wear a black and gold leotard, covering most of his body outside his head and arms. ","personality":"Mammoth is easy to anger, with a short temper and low self-control. Far from the sharpest tool in the shed, he gets especially angry when people insult his intelligence. He\'s been shown to occasionally be kind towards some, although his destructive outbursts ending with several destroyed buildings, vehicles and injured or dead people paint him as a wanted villain in most people\'s eyes.","powers":"Mammoth\'s powers rely on his physicality, more so than anything else. His strength is remarkable, easily able to lift 1000 tonnes with his outstanding strength, like a pair of double decker buses or long-haul trucks, and his toughness is similarly legendary, able to seemingly ignore many forms of physical damage that\'d kill other heroes. Even when hurt, he heals from damage extremely quickly, and his powerful legs allow him to jump well over a mile in distance in a single bound. If his immense power wasn\'t clear yet, he can grow in size to a height of about 10 meters, like a 5 storey building, where his strength and toughness grow even more, able to rip skyscrapers off the ground or throw a car over a hundred miles off.","achievements":"All things considered, Mammoth is still a young villain, yet his potential is obvious to all who see him. Using his outstanding strength and toughness, he\'s stolen over a ton of gold (worth over 50 million dollars) from one of the most fortified banks in the country by simply ripping off the walls and carrying the whole vault, leaping into the distance. When he\'s gotten angry, he\'s destroyed entire city blocks as well. He\'s battled and defeated veteran hero Blue Cyborg twice, and has yet to be apprehended for his crimes."},{"name":"Brian Steel","allegiance":"Villain","threatClass":"S","organization":"Independent","appearance":"A very tall, yet mostly ordinary looking man of latino descent, in his 30s. Usually wearing rather normal, cheap clothing, such as jeans and t-shirts.","personality":"Brian has been described by those who\'ve met him as a nihilist. A cynic who has never truly enjoyed life, and certainly doesn\'t believe there is a point to it. His indifference to the lives of others has proven to be the cause of large-scale deaths and property damage.","powers":"While Brian\'s powers are certainly not obvious at first sight, many who\'ve tried to attack him have seen exactly what he\'s capable of. Not only is he superhumanly strong, lifting over a dozen tons with ease, and surprisingly agile and quick for a man his size, along with significant combat capabilities, his defining feature is his durability. Even compared to other toughness heavyweights, Brian has shown to be entirely immune to damage of all sorts until now. Disregarding bullets, stabbing weaponry and large explosives without flinching, along with freezing cold, lightning strikes and fire breaths at most burning off his skin to reveal a metallic shell below it. In fact, attempts to starve him have proven fruitless as even basic necessities and aging itself have shown no impact on him.","achievements":"Despite one of the most incredible defensive suites of any Super seen yet, Brian has primarily kept to occasionally robbing jewelry or other luxury stores for goods to sell in the black market, and has kept from injuring bystanders as he does so (though he has no qualms with severely injuring or killing police officers or heroes who attempt to stop him). Considering his lack of need for sustenance, along with rather humble apparent possessions, it is unclear what he does with the money from these assaults."},{"name":"Sophia Mason","alias":"Nightshade","allegiance":"Neutral","threatClass":"S","organization":"Independent","appearance":"When Nightshade\'s powers are dormant, she appears as a woman of (5\'5\\"/165cm) and ectomorphic build. Slightly underweight. Dull red/orange hair  and as of this writing is mid-back length. Angular and unremarkable face, dotted with freckles. Eyes are green. Her standard eyesight is rather poor and as such she requires glasses when in her human form. Taste is fashion is terrible.When her powers are activated, Nightshade takes the form of an almost entirely different being- Height remains static but gains body mass; black full body suit manifests in a fractal pattern. Witnessing this seems to cause irritated and watery eyes. Hair color changes to black and shortens exponentially; sclera turns black and irises become blue. Left arm appears to be constructed mostly of blue energy of unknown origin.","personality":"Regardless of form, her personality stays mostly static. Nightshade is typically awkward and potentially standoffish. Obsessed with cults, magic, and insects. Does appear to be more confident and assertive when powers are manifested.","powers":"Nightshade\'s source of power is currently unknown. Her powers include:\\n-Manifestation of black tentacles; capable of delivering strong kinetic strikes and can immobilize opponents.\\n-Ability to see perfectly in darkness. Has a perfect understanding of time.\\n-Rapid teleportation ability of over 250 feet. Teleportation effect is accompanied by faint screams.\\n-Can rapidly heal wounds in complete darkness.\\n-Possesses several immunities: disease, poison, environmental conditions, and suffocation. Does not appear to require food or water; eats/drinks out of pleasure.","achievements":"N/A."},{"name":"Leonel Godfried Lionheart","alias":"Golden Leon","allegiance":"Hero","threatClass":"A","organization":"The Squad","appearance":"A tall, muscular blonde man, with a set of large sideburns and goatee. While in his heroic persona, he wears a set of plate-mail and a large two-handed sword, glowing with light.","personality":"Loud, Brash, Bold and Optimistic are all ways to describe Golden Leon\'s personality. A chivalrous knight with a splenderous devotion to his god, he fights for what he believes to be truth, justice and good. Although his positivism and religious fervor can also make him rather annoying to his comrades in arms.","powers":"Leonel\'s soul has been seemingly fused with that of his blade, the Crusader\'s Blade, which gives him a significantly enhanced fighting ability and the ability to regenerate damage whenever under sunlight, run far faster than usual and immunity to bullets and aging. His blade is a powerful weapon, blessed with divine power, that allows him to slice through metal. Furthermore, when he dies, as long as his sword hasn\'t been destroyed, he returns to life within 3 days.","achievements":"Over the past millenia, Golden Leon has been involved in numerous works for the Kingdom of Leon and the Catholic church, participating the Requonquista of Iberia, the Crusades, the unification of Galicia and Aragon and finally disappearing during the Napoleonic Wars. While at first believed to be a line of different \'Golden Leons\' it\'s been found to be the soul of an original one that moves from wielder to wielder, taking different faces over the ages. Recently, in the early 2000s his mighty blade has been found by an american tourist named Leonel Lionheart in Barcelona who took on the mantle of the latest Golden Leon of the 21st Century."},{"name":"Roxy King","alias":"Hysteric","allegiance":"Hero","threatClass":"S+++ (Self-assigned)","organization":"The Squad","appearance":"Tall (6\'2\\"/187cm) and very muscular woman with long spiky hair in her early 30s (31). Her right eye seems to be blind, and her body is covered with scars and few piercings. Her superhero costume usually consists of a tank top (varies), a metallic cage-like muzzle, and a metal collar with a small broken metal chain hanging from it.","personality":"Hysteric is a crude, arrogant, short-tempered, and aggressive person. Commonly seen taunting her opponents in combat. She tends to come off unheroic, if not downright villainous at times to those who are not familiar with her. Has a nervous tick (needs confirmation), making her grin and show her teeth when under high emotional pressure. Besides these questionable personality traits, she has never been seen intentionally killing her foes, rather they end up getting caught as collateral damage. She has a very fierce competitive drive and desires to be the first and best at everything, signs of a superiority complex. Hysteric is immensely prideful and prefers to act alone, as she hates the idea of being protected or having to rely on other people to assist her unless, in the latter\'s case, she is recognized as the unquestionable leading figure within a team. Despite this she is unwavering in her aspirations of heroism, having outright refused multiple recruit attempts by multiple high-tier villains. Rumored to have a softer side, not confirmed. The biggest evidence of this is her somewhat infrequent emotional metal songs.","powers":"Hysteric is able to split into five duplicates of herself, all of them seem to be identical in looks and powers. During fights, she seems to rely on her physical prowess, which seems almost inhuman at times. She uses weapons very rarely and mostly relies on her fists and legs. Compensating for her poor eyesight, she has a very keen sense of smell. She can pinpoint something\'s exact location and she can smell fine details, allowing her to distinguish between and identify different subjects.","achievements":"Probably the most hated woman in Calavera among the villains and criminals."},{"name":"Alyss Winona Little","alias":"ALLyss","allegiance":"Hero","threatClass":"A","organization":"Independent","appearance":"Varies between forms. Standard is (4\'8\\"/142cm), (75lbs/34Kg), quite doll like.  Has cosmic hair that is always in motion. Looks more like a mahou shoujo than a traditional Super Heroine. Dresses in a traditionally objectified costume with a modern twist.","personality":"Kind. Caring. Whimsically curious. Suffering from PTSD. Needs to keep busy or the flashbacks catch up.","powers":"Can metamorph into any version of himself that exists in the multiverse. His form is determined by perception and the way Alyss is viewed by others and by himself. This can be exploited as demonstrated by Mistress Maternal.","achievements":"Mostly has stopped and prevented petty crime. Regularly volunteers his super powers to help the less fortunate. Spent time enslaved by Mistress Maternal but never broke. Biggest accomplishment was defeating Mistress Maternal, leading to the Super Villain\'s arrest."},{"name":"Terran Toola","alias":"Runtime","allegiance":"Hero","threatClass":"C","organization":"The Squad","appearance":"A small, stocky humanoid half-alien, (4\'7\\"/140cm) tall. They have large eyes with huge black pupils that usually cover most of the eye. Their head is larger than a human\'s. To avoid suspicion, they camouflage themself as a human with short, neck-length hair, dyed in a variety of colors. Likewise, to camouflage their alien physique, they wear large loose-fitting clothes and large round sunglasses to hide their unusual eyes.","personality":"Sassy, quippy, sometimes childish. They have a strong sense of justice and responsibility for people from lower-income classes, as well as a strong hatred for the rich and powerful. They will not hesitate to talk at length about it. They\'re inquisitive and curious, and seek to learn as much as they can from as many sources as they can. They consider information power, and seek to use it to create as many connections as they can, in order to achieve their goals.","powers":"Their main power consists of the enhanced intelligence that comes from their alien heritage, which gives them superhuman investigation, persuasion, technology and perception skills. With it they built a suit made for spying and reconnaissance, with the ability to follow tracks, see in infrared and through cover and enhanced vision, hearing and smell, as well as an AI capable of taking in the vast amounts of information on their database to model events past and future. Their suit also contains a jetpack and sonic gun for when they get caught in combat. Besides their suit, they also have at their disposal two \'Spiderbots\', spherical robots with combat, cloaking and recon capabilities, that they control remotely.","achievements":"Their major achievement is the creating of Spyderweb, a vast resource of information on villains, heroes and other people of interest. They used this to stop villain\'s plans and enhance the effectiveness of any hero in their network. They\'re directly involved in the rise of multiple superheroes."},{"alias":"Black Mirror","allegiance":"Villain","threatClass":"A","organization":"Hall of Marvels","appearance":"An average sized, dark haired girl with bright blue eyes. Mostly slender, though with a noticeable hourglass figure. When in her supervillain costume, wears a violet skin-tight outfit covering most of her body, except for her face, where she wears a mask around her upper face, and her cleavage.","personality":"Known for being quite flirty, even with her enemies, Black Mirror is manipulative and seductive. However, her abilities of deception and manipulation are vast enough that a complete analysis of her personality has yet to be done, so all her actions may still be a fa\xe7ade.","powers":"While physically Black Mirror has only above-average abilities, and is no more dangerous than a professional acrobat. However, her capacity to manipulate people\'s minds is extremely dangerous. Able to use powerful charms to mind control her targets, or cause severe psychic damage, she\'s been known to turn heroes against their allies with merely a few words. Not only that, she has proven capable of creating illusions, tricking her foes with phantasms to misdirect them, or even cause pain with them, or disguise herself or turn completely invisible.","achievements":"Aside from grand burglary, Black Mirror has been involved in manipulating law enforcement officers and politicians to aid herself and her allies in many situations. Rarely getting physical due to her weak physical abilities (by Super standards), she instead manipulates others to act as her muscle and henchmen. Currently she\'s been seen working with Charmcaster, Grimm and Fantasia in the House of Marvels villainous faction, turning an already dangerous villain alone into a true challenge for any group of heroes to face."},{"name":"Astrid Nilsen","allegiance":"Hero","threatClass":"A","organization":"Independent","appearance":"Female, (5\'11\\"/180cm). Defined muscular physique, appears to be quite agile as well. Hair is bright red with a sheen that resembles the appearance of magma. Prefers to wear traditional Nordic outfits, specifically a reliance on furs and her trademark valkyrie armor.","personality":"Prideful, caring towards her companions. Vengeful against those who commit wrongdoings against her or her \\"tribe\\".","powers":"Astrid can manipulate lightning to strike from the sky and can also manifest this power into her dual axes or create wings of electricity. Has died and if struck down, she returns to Valhalla and will be reborn with the ability to return to Earth.","achievements":"Has a history of fending off raiders from her lands before her death in the 11th century. Was blessed and made it into Valhalla alongside the greatest viking warriors. In her current post-mortality state, it\'s currently unknown what else she may be capable of."},{"name":"Jennifer Slate","alias":"Jenny Shred","allegiance":"Neutral","threatClass":"B","organization":"Independent","appearance":"(5\'2\\"/157cm), (98lbs/44kg), bright pink hair, extremely pale skin. Is always seen wearing jeans and leather sporting a Mohawk. No apparent superhero outfit, as she blurs the line between her private life and public persona. Her fans call her \\"Real life Tank Girl\\", referring to a comic character of the same name from more than 35 years ago.","personality":"Shred is known to be a loose cannon, reckless, and unapologetic. Constantly ignores the world around her, often seen wearing headphones. Even though people in her country look up to her as a savior of the poor and helpless, she can be unpredictable when it comes to dealing with adversaries, leaving some permanently damaged. Further study is required of Ms. Shred, but approach with caution.","powers":"Shred possesses an ability her fans have dubbed \\"Rebel Yell\\", which is a sonic attack capable of inflicting major damage in a cone in front of her. Has used a version of it on security footage that caused no damage, but rendered everyone in the area incapacitated. No other powers known at this time.","achievements":"First recorded use of her power was the destruction of a known arms dealer\'s home in Rio de Janeiro. During a fight with local authorities and private contractors belonging to one \\"Jose Suez\\", toppled a section of the Carioca Aqueduct. Led a destructive protest through Sao Paulo in the name of government corruption, leading to millions in damages, but all damage was contained to property of a subsidiary owned by Mr. Suez (see notes).","notes":"While it seems that she may be classified as a villain, her criminal record is all tied to known arms dealers, drug cartels, and most importantly, Jose Suez (entry pending), A known billionaire philanthropist. Further research indicates that Mr. Suez is linked to many nations who have mysteriously come into possession of nuclear weapons, and is considered a serious danger."}]')},function(e,a,n){"use strict";n.r(a);var t,i=n(0),s=n.n(i),o=n(3),r=n.n(o),l=(n(9),n(4)),h=(n(10),n(1)),c=n(12);!function(e){e.HERO="Hero",e.VILLAIN="Villain",e.NEUTRAL="Neutral"}(t||(t={}));var d=function(){var e=Object(i.useState)("Hello!
